			     <p>There are many ways you can reduce the costs of your travels. I traveled on a budget of $1000 for two months in Europe. I chose Spain and Portugal since they were less expensive and had warm weather in the months of February and March. Here are a couple of tips that I followed to meet my budget:</p>

			    <h3>1. Pick less expensive cities and countries</h3>

					<p>Research <a href="https://www.contiki.com/six-two/budget-friendly-european-countries/" target="_blank">inexpensive countries</a> and <a href="https://www.myglobalviewpoint.com/cheapest-cities-in-europe/">cities</a> to visit. Some top affordable options include The Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Ireland.</p>

				<h3>2. Stay in hostels for cheap</h3>

					<p>An affordable and safe option for traveling is hostels. There are youth hostels or hostels that accept people of all ages. Hostels are great option for making friends while <a href="tips-solo-traveling-safely.html">solo traveling</a> as well.</p>

				<h3>3. Volunteer or for free accommodations</h3>

					<p><a href="https://www.workaway.info/" target="_blank">Workaway</a> or <a href="https://wwoof.net/">WWOOF</a> are two resources for working in exchange for free accommodations. I had a great experience volunteering at a hostel through Workaway in Portugal with other volunteers from around the world.</p>

				<h3>4. Find free and cheap activities</h3>

					<p>While there are lots of opportunities to spend money on tourist attractions, you can limit spending on these and enjoy free or low-cost activities. Examples include siteseeing on the street, visiting parks and natural reserves, and buying food from the local market for a picnic. You can use the extra money in your budget for attractions that are at the top of your list.</p>
