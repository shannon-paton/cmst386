	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<h3>Describe how search engines work (minimum 50 words)</h3>
		<p>
			Search engines work by crawling and indexing websites, which include files, documents, pages, news, videos, and media on the World Wide Web. Through crawling these files, they decipher code, store an immense amount of data, and then provide optimized answers to users when they input their search queries. Search engines determine including rank and popularity of websites through mathematical equations, called algorithms, in order to determine the rank of websites. <a href="https://d2eeipcrcdle6.cloudfront.net/guides/Moz-The-Beginners-Guide-To-SEO.pdf" target="_blank">(Source)</a>

	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<h3>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags (minimum 50 words).</h3>
		<p>
			Meta tags are used to help search engines display specific information about your site that you want to display to users. The meta description is a tag that is put in the header of webpage and will override the default description that Google would give a page, which is usually just the first part of the body of the text on the page. Keywords are important in order for users to find relevant content, so should be used in the URL and H1 or other titles and meta description of the site. However, you should avoid overly using keywords since this can negatively affect your rankings on search engines. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide?hl=en" target="_blank">(Source)</a>

	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	<h3>List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links (minimum 50 words).</h3>

	<p>
		Content links may link to content on your site (internal) or to content on another site (external). This hyperlink text can be optimized to help users find the content they are looking for. The hyperlink text should be descriptive in that it gives a basic idea about the content it is linking to. It should also be concise â€“ usually a few words or short phrase. The links should also be easily findable, formatted so they are easy to see and stand out from the text with a different color and/or styling. Finally, anchor text for internal links can be useful for users and search engines to find the different sections on your site. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide?hl=en" target="_blank">(Source)</a>
	</p>


	<h2>Question 4</h2>
	<h3>What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with more than one heading tag (minimum 50 words).</h3>

	<p>
		It is important to have a good page hierarchy so that search engines and users can more easily navigate and find content on your site. A good way of thinking about this is pretending that you're writing an outline for your page copy, and using the headers to structure the page in this way. Also, you should use headings sparingly, as too many or too long of headings can clutter the page and make it more difficult to navigate. The main heading should be an h1, and there should only be one of these per page. The headings should follow in descending importance or smaller topics on the page as h2, h3, etc. and pages with the same level of importance should share the same type of header tag. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide?hl=en" target="_blank">(Source)</a>

	<h1>Website Title</h1>

	<h2>Title of First Blog Post</h2>

	<h3>Subtitle of Blog Post</h3>

	<p>Text of blog post...</p>

	<h2>Title of Second Blog Post</h2>

	<h3>Subtitle of Second Blog Post</h3>

	<p>Text of blog post...</p>
