	<h1>Project 2 CMST386 Principles of Web Design and Technology II</h1>

	<p>Shannon Paton</p>
	<p><em>November 9, 2021</em></p>

	<h2>Project Proposal:</h2>

	<h3>1. Client and Topic</h3>

	<p>For my project, I plan to design and create a blog and web-based business on the topic of traveling on a budget. This web platform will be a personal blog primarily focused on resources for traveling including country-specific blog posts, a product page linking to featured related products to purchase, and tips for solo traveling and/or living as a digital nomad.</p>

	<h3>2. Development Process and Engagement</h3>

	<p>I am making this website for myself. I will do research on other blogs that are similar (market research) to get a sense of what exists already, what is popular, and what need still exists in this niche. I'll also go through my photos from my travels and talk to friends and family about what they would like to learn on a blog like this.</p>

	<h3>3. Testing</h3>

	<p>I will proofread all of the content, and make sure there are no spelling or semantic errors in my writing. I will also ensure that all page elements load and are fully accessible on different interfaces, including different browsers and screen sizes. I will test on a Google Pixel phone, a Macbook Air, iPad, and on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.</p>

	<h3>4. Description</h3>

	<p>The goal of the business is to share blog posts, feature relevant products, and connect users to resources that will help them in their own travel goals. The website will be the primary platofrm in which the business is run. The intended target audience is Millenials and Gen Z users who are interested in alternative lifestyles, personal finance, and self improvement. Assuming this, it is important that the website is fully accessible on all screen sizes, since these audiences will be likely to access to the website from smartphones and tabelts in addition to laptops. The website will include unique blog posts, SEO optimized titles, and photo descriptions written by me. I also plan to use my own photos from travels I have been on. I may also design a logo using Adobe Illustrator.  I will supplement with photos that I find online from royalty-free photo websites such as Unsplash. I plan to add new content weekly, and update the homepage and other page copy on a monthly basis.</p>

	<h3>5. Growth and Maintenance</h3>

	<p>As I write more blog posts for the website and add more content, the site will attract more visistors over time. To make the webiste easier to maintain, I will organize the website clearly with folders and url paths that are representative of the site structure. I will also ensure that filenames are clear and consistent. I plan to add new content weekly, and update the homepage and other page copy on a monthly basis or as needed. If entirely new sections are added to the site, then new folders and url structures will need to be updated.</p>

	<h3>6. Organization</h3>

		<p>The website will include the following subtopics:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>About</li>
			<li>Contact</li>
			<li>Blog</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Costa Rica</li>
					<li>Spain</li>
					<li>Portugal</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Solo traveling post</li>
					<li>Digital nomad post</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Resources</li>
			<li>Shop</li>
		</ul>

			<h4>Storyboard</h4>
			<img src="images/travel-storyboard.png" alt="sitemap" width="800">

			<p>As shown in the storyboard above, the user will land on the homepage to start. From there, they will be able to navigate to About, Contact, Blog, Resources, and Shop. From the About page they will also be able to access the Contact page with CTA button. The blog will feature a number of posts, which can be filtered by location or topic.</p>


			<h4>Wireframes</h4>



			<img src="images/homepage.png" alt="homepage wireframe" width="500">


			<img src="images/blog-page.png" alt="blog page wireframe" width="500">

				<p>The homepage will feature the page title and tagline, as well as a featured post at the top to engage the user. If they "continue reading" then they will go that specific blog page, and see more featured articles at the bottom of the next page. There will be an "About me' Preview section where the user can either navigate to the About page or Contact page. The next section will be a map with clickable locations that lead to blog posts from those locations. Next, there is a "More from the blog" teaser section, as well as "Featured items" which will lead users ot the shopping section of the site. Finally, at the bottom there are the site icon, social icons, contact me button again, and copyright.</p>

				<p>The blog post has a similar layout but is simpler. It has the article and then the same article teasers and shopping teasers, and footer at the bottom of the page. The navigation is also the same on each of the pages.</p>



	<h3>7. Security</h3>

	<p>The website will include a shopping section, but will be based on sending users to affiliate links to make a portion of the profit without having an entire e-commerce section. Putting up an entire ecommerce site includes components and complexities that are beyond what is needed for a site and business of this size (Strikingly, n.d.).</p>

	<p>To help secure the website as a web designer and developer, I will ensure that no personal 
	details about the owner or anyone else are listed on the website (besides the physical address 
	and business phone number of the business). I will also ensure that there is an SSL certificate obtained and that the domain is locked through the web host provider platform (Kallos, 2020).</p>

	<h3>8. Web Hosting</h3>

	<p>I would use cost, reliability, and ease of use to select a web host. EIG acquired web hosts have a generally bad reputation in the web development community for being too large and having slow customer services and large outages at times, so I would not choose an EIG-owned web host (McKinsey, 2021). Dreamhost and Siteground are both highly-rated and non-EIG domain hosts, and have high ratings for quality of service for money spent. Finally, I would check that the host supports the use of Wordpress.org since I would likely use this as a CMS for the site, and Dreamhost and Siteground both support this fully (Newcomer, 2020).</p>

	<p>The site will need to support HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript since the web content will be created using those languages.</p>

	<h3>9. Marketing</h3>

	<p>I would use Instagram, Twitter and Facebook for marketing. I would wait until the site had more content to consider paid promotion. However, on all blog posts I would aim to write Search Engine Optimized content in order to receive a high ranking on Google to draw in new visitors organically. It is important to choose search engine optimized taglines and headers (especially for h2’s and h3’s on the site). I would also ensure that pages have descriptive and SEO-rich descriptions (Morris, 2021).</p>

	<p>For a domain, an option to purchase is shannonstravels.com. It is short and easy to remember, and is available to purchase for $12/year from Google Domains. It has both my name and the main subject of the site which is traveling. A downside of the url is that there can't be an apostrephe in "shannon's" so people could get it mixed up with shannontravels.com (which is taken).</p>
